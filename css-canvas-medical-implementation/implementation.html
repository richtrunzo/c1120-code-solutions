        <p><span class="one">1.</span>  Making the Decision to Switch</p>
        <p class="calc-graf">You should only move forward with Canvas if and when you have determined that<br>
          we far outperform other vendors and offer an unmatched return on investment. Our<br>
          goal is to give you as much information as possible to make this determination one<br>
          way or the other. We will provide access to a sandbox of the Canvas application for<br>
          you to get a feel for the platform as well as references to current customers to talk<br>
          about their experience.
        </p>
        <p><span class="two">2.</span>  Interfaces and Community Integration</p>
        <p class="calc-graf">Canvas is meant to integrate with your existing interfaces and community<br>
        resources. At a minimum, this means porting over your fax number, enrolling your<br>
        payers with our clearinghouse, and getting bidirectional lab feeds running. We'll<br>
        also load your preferred specialists and imaging centers into Canvas so that<br>
        sending referrals and closing loops is seamless. Finally, if interfaces with health<br>
        information exchanges or other information technology vendors are important, we<br>
        will work with you to determine what we can deliver and when.
        </p>
        <p><span class="three">3.</span>  Data Migration</p>
        <p class="calc-graf">The first thing we will do is gain access to a full backup of your current data, which<br>
        we have executed successfully with both remotely hosted and on-premise EMR<br>
        databases. Then our work begins to import into Canvas. Patient demographics and<br>
        information like medications, problems, and allergies is relatively straightforward.<br>
        While importing clinical notes and documents is more challenging, our team has<br>
        been able to do this at a high level of fidelity with a wide variety of EMRs.
        </p>
        <p><span class="four">4.</span>  Training and Site Visit</p>
        <p class="calc-graf">We will work with you to configure Canvas properly, including clinical content,<br>
        charge schedules, and much more. Role-based trainings will be done a few weeks<br>
        prior to go-live to familiarize relevant team members with clinical, practice<br>
        management, and billing workflows. Either before or during go-live, one of our<br>
        team can visit your practice to work side-by-side with you on implementation and<br>
        training.
        </p>
        <p><span class="five">5.</span>  Go-Live and Tuning</p>
        <p class="calc-graf">Go-live is when you start using Canvas with real patients in your practice. We will be<br>
        with you, either in-person or remotely depending on your preference, to make sure<br>
        everything goes smoothly. There is always fine tuning to do once you have a<br>
        handful of encounters in Canvas under your belt: changing clinical microtemplates,<br>
        setting up new automations, modifying practice management settings, and more.<br>
        We are here to help with it all.
        </p>
        <p><span class="six">6.</span>  Sustained Performance</p>
        <p class="calc-graf">All EMR contracts should contain assurances against broken promises and provide<br>
        support over the long term. Our Performance Warranty means that if we are not<br>
        meeting expectations, you can terminate the agreement and receive all payments<br>
        back. We do not expect this to happen). For our Standard plans, we also offer a<br>
        MIPS guarantee: if you receive a negative adjustment, we will cover it And for<br>
        everyone, we provide unlimited 24/7 support at no charge. We expect this to be a<br>
        long, productive partnership for us both.
